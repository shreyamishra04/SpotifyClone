Spotify Clone ðŸŽµ

This project is a basic Spotify clone developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate my front-end web development skills. 
It features a responsive, user-friendly interface with core playback functionality such as play, pause, and next. 
Through this project,I enhanced myunderstanding of creating interactive web applications and gained experience with version control using Git and GitHub.
This serves as a foundational step in my learning journey.
